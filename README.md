## ‚ú® Features

Pomo-04 is built to provide an uninterrupted, distraction-free environment with advanced browser APIs:

| **Feature** | **Description** | 
| :--- | :--- |
| **üß† Screen Wake Lock** | Uses the Wake Lock API to prevent your screen from dimming or sleeping while the timer is running, ensuring continuous focus. | 
| **üñ•Ô∏è Fullscreen Mode** | Dedicated fullscreen button provides a completely distraction-free, immersive study environment. | 
| **üíæ Persistent Settings** | Saves your customized Study and Break durations using `localStorage`, so your preferences are retained across sessions and refreshes. | 
| **üîî Desktop Notifications** | Sends OS-level notifications when a session ends (Study -> Break or Break -> Study), even if the tab is minimized or in the background. | 
| **üí° Tab Title Timer** | The remaining time is displayed directly in the browser tab title, allowing you to monitor progress even when viewing other research tabs. | 
| **üé® Smooth Transitions** | The background color smoothly transitions between Study (Black) and Break (Deep Blue) modes, providing a calming visual cue for the cycle change. | 
| **üîí Edit Confirmation** | Prevents accidental changes: you cannot edit the Study or Break times while the timer is running. Attempting to edit will prompt a confirmation to pause the timer first. |
